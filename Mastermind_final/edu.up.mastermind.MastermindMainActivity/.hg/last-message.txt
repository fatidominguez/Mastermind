I've made several changes to the code as I used this framework to create several example games.  Highlights:
- AndroidManifest.xml was modified so that GameMainActivity wont' be launched by default
- the OnCreate methods in the framework were made final so the student can't modify them.  
- minor adjustments to the config screen layout attemping (unsuccessfully) to get the Start button to float up when the virtual keyboard is displayed
